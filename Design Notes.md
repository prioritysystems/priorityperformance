Design Notes:


Nomination Reference Number



Image Reference Number


With Images vs With no images


Modal Reference
Modal references are unique auto-generated numbers everytime a nomination is submitted, regardless of whether the nomination include an image or not. This allow the mapping of each modal to the matching profile.
